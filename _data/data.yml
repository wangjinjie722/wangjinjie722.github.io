#        details: A new paradigm is proposed for autonomous driving. The new paradigm lies between the end-to-end and pipelined approaches, and is inspired by how humans solve the problem. The objects that could originate hazard are denoted as action-inducing. They also define a set of explanations for these actions, which should be produced jointly with the latter. An extension of the BDD100K dataset is proposed. A new multi-task formulation of the problem, which optimizes the accuracy of both action commands and explanations, is then introduced. A CNN architecture is finally proposed to solve this problem.
